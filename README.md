# Advance Project-8
# iPhone Purchase Prediction
# Model used : Decision Tree
# Project objective :

Build a predictive model using the Decision Tree algorithm to predict whether a customer will purchase an iPhone based on demographic information.This model aims to assist in understanding factors influencing iPhone purchases and optimizing marketing strategies. 

## Dataset
 Name: iPhone purchase 
 Column :Gender
 
         Age
         
         Salary
         
         Purchase iPhone 
# Methodology 

### 1. Requirements:
   Python 
   
   Pandas
   
   Seaborn 
   
   Matplotlib
   
   Scikit-learn

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Data Overview:

Examined the structure of the dataset.
Reviewed summary statistics for key variables.

#### Demographic Insights:

Analyzed the distribution of Gender, Age, and Salary.
Explored relationships between these variables.

#### Purchase Patterns:

Investigated purchase patterns based on demographic attributes.
Visualized the distribution of iPhone purchases.

### 2. Problem Definition:

Defined the problem: Predict iPhone purchase based on demographic features.

### 3. Feature Selection:

Selected key features: Gender, Age, and Salary.

Defined 'Purchase iPhone' as the target variable.

### 4.Model Selection:

Utilized the Decision Tree algorithm for classification.

Decision trees are effective for capturing non-linear relationships in the data.


### 5. Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained the Decision Tree model on the training data.

### 6. Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model's performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Examined the decision tree structure for insights into feature importance.
